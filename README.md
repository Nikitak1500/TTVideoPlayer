Video player app â€“ Developed to strengthen my skills in building applications with modern architecture and to master Jetpack Compose. The app was built using Kotlin, with ExoPlayer for video playback. Room was used for video caching, and Retrofit was employed to fetch video information. I mastered the process of creating interfaces using Jetpack Compose and enhanced my knowledge of Dagger and Hilt for dependency injection.
